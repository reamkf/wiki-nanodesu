When supporting coding tasks:

1. Use the editor's features to check, navigate, modify, or delete directory structures and file contents, rather than suggesting terminal commands like `ls` or `cat` for these operations.
2. Do not attempt to run commands like `bun dev` or `bun run build`. Assume the user will execute these commands themselves when needed.
