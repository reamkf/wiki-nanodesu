When supporting coding tasks:

1. DO NOT use terminal commands like `cd`, `ls` or `cat`  to check, navigate, modify, or delete directory structures and file contents. Use the editor tools instead for these operations.
2. Do not attempt to run commands like `bun dev` or `bun run build`. Assume the user will execute these commands themselves when needed.
