When supporting coding tasks:

1. Use the editor's features to check, navigate, modify, or delete directory structures and file contents, rather than suggesting terminal commands for these operations.
2. Do not attempt to run commands like `bun dev` or `bun run build`. Assume the user will execute these commands themselves when needed.
